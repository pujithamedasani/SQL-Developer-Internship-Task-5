Cartesian Product :

In unrestricted join or Cartesian product of two tables all possible concatenations are formed of all rows to both the tables is called a cartesian product .

Equi-Join and Natural Join :

The join in which columns are compared for equality is called Equi-Join.

A non-equi-join as a query that specifies some relationship other than equality between the columns .

The join in which only one of the identical columns (coming from join tables) exists is called Natural join.

The equi join and natural join are equivalent except the duplicate columns are eliminated in the natural join that would otherwise appear in the Equi-Join.
