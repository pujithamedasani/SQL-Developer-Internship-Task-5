As we first take two tables from our library schema.
We’ll use :
1. Members – who borrows books
2. Loans – records of books loaned to members

Now our objective is to combine data from multiple tables 
Now let us use INNER , LEFT , RIGHT , FULL JOIN between these two tables:
 
Members (MemberID, Name, Email, JoinDate)  
Loans (LoanID, BookID, MemberID, StaffID, LoanDate, DueDate, ReturnDate)

JOINS :
A join is a query that combines rows from two or more tables. In a join query , more than one tables is listed in FROM clause. The function combining data from multiple tables is called joining. 
The WHERE clause is most often used to perform the JOIN function where two or more tables have common columns.

1.	INNER JOIN:
It only shows members who have loan records 

Syntax :

SELECT table1.column1 , table1.column2 , table2.column1, .... 
FROM table1 
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

We can also write JOIN instead of INNER JOIN. JOIN is same as INNER JOIN.

Query:

SELECT Members.MemberID, Members.Name, Loans.LoanID, Loans.LoanDate
FROM Members
INNER JOIN Loans ON Members.MemberID = Loans.MemberID;

Output:

+----------+------+--------+------------+
| MemberID | Name | LoanID | LoanDate   |
+----------+------+--------+------------+
|        1 | Doe  |      1 | 2025-06-01 |
+----------+------+--------+------------+
