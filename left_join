2. LEFT JOIN :

It shows all members, even those who never borrowed a book .

Syntax:

SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

Query:

SELECT Members.MemberID, Members.Name, Loans.LoanID, Loans.LoanDate
FROM Members
LEFT JOIN Loans ON Members.MemberID = Loans.MemberID;

- If the LoanID is NULL , then the member hasnâ€™t borrowed anything.

Output:

+----------+------+--------+------------+
| MemberID | Name | LoanID | LoanDate   |
+----------+------+--------+------------+
|        1 | Doe  |      1 | 2025-06-01 |
|        2 | Jane |   NULL | NULL       |
+----------+------+--------+------------+
