4. FULL OUTER JOIN (Not supported natively, run it with UNION) :

Syntax :

SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,….
FROM table1 
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column; 

•	table1 : First table.
•	table2 : Second table
•	matching_column : Column common to both the tables.

It shows all members and all loans, including unmatched ones on either side .

Query :

-- FULL OUTER JOIN = LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN minus duplicates

SELECT Members.MemberID, Members.Name, Loans.LoanID, Loans.LoanDate
FROM Members
LEFT JOIN Loans ON Members.MemberID = Loans.MemberID

UNION

SELECT Members.MemberID, Members.Name, Loans.LoanID, Loans.LoanDate
FROM Members
RIGHT JOIN Loans ON Members.MemberID = Loans.MemberID;

Output:

+----------+------+--------+------------+
| MemberID | Name | LoanID | LoanDate   |
+----------+------+--------+------------+
|        1 | Doe  |      1 | 2025-06-01 |
|        2 | Jane |   NULL | NULL       |
+----------+------+--------+------------+

If using SQLite , replace RIGHT JOIN with :

SELECT Loans.MemberID, Members.Name, Loans.LoanID, Loans.LoanDate
FROM Loans
LEFT JOIN Members ON Loans.MemberID = Members.MemberID
WHERE Members.MemberID IS NULL;
